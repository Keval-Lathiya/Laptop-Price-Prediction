# Laptop-Price-Prediction

This is one of my weekend projects. I have used various machine learning models to predict the laptop's price in this project.

### Data Description
The dataset has already been randomly divided into the training, validation, and test sets. It is stored in 3 files: train_dataset.json, val_dataset.json, and test_dataset.json respectively. Each file is JSON saved in orient=’columns’ format.
